"""
Sample PyQT frontend for Takyaq.

Uses a mocked camera and piezo motor: replace those parts with real interfaces
to have a fully functional stabilization program.

Use:
    - Set the parameters:
         - nm per pixel XY
         - nm per pixel Z
    - Create XY ROIS and move and size them to encompass the fiducial marks
    - Create a Z ROI and move and size them to encompass the beam reflection
    - Start tracking of XY and Z rois. While tracking is active, erasing or
    changing the ROIs positions has no effect.
    - Start correction of XY and Z positions.
